this github repo was made because i have a huge tendency to just magically lose data (not very good)

the below will show my servers and the numerous ways and times i got downed


## dell inspiron 1545
1. IP change (dynamic IPs on spectrum is :fire:)
2. someone who had access fucked debian in the ass -- caused grub to literally not identify debian
3. zorinOS update failed -- this was before i switched to debian
4. hard drive literally was dying and causing massive I/O errors that would cause all networking and services to go down
5. my parents finding the laptop server in my room (im not allowed to have tech in my room) and then ***UNPLUGGING IT WITHOUT DOING A PROPER SHUTDOWN***
6. my parents finding the laptop in the living room connected to the router and and ***UNPLUGGED IT WITHOUT A PROPER SHUTDOWN*** and disconnected everything like ethernet
7. someone constantly fucking the nginx config
8. that one time when i accidentally ran `rm -rf /*` instead of `rm -rf ./*` (no you do not need `--no-preserve-root` when removing `/*`)
9. power outage
10. spectrum internet outage
11. that one time when the network drivers kept fucking themselves

## hp chromebook 11 g6 ee (alan)
1. the charger got unplugged and the battery slowly died

## dell chromebook 3100 (fleex)
1. the chromebook literally BRICKED itself on a `/sbin/reboot` and would not POST

## lenovo ideapad 3 14iml05 
1. this is actually been a reliable server despite being an absolute shit laptop in total
