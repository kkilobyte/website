		<h2>Passive cooling sucks.</h2>
		<p>Have you ever used a modern MacBook with an Apple Silicon M chip? 
		Or some cheap Netbook? Or an iPhone 6s? Have you noticed how <b><i>HOT</i></b>
		it got when doing intensive or sometimes even simple basic tasks? <br><br>
		
		You can thank passive cooling for that, the fan-less design found in Netbooks, Ultrabooks, or even your phone.
		Now I will admit passive cooling is sometimes great, like in phones or tablets,
		however not in higher power Ultrabooks like the MacBook Pro or Lenovo Yoga w/ an 8th Gen i7, 
		or even the lap warmer Celeron/Pentium Netbooks often with Chromebook branding, 
		or hell even <b><i>DESKTOPS</i></b> like the Dell Inspiron 20 3052! As of writing this, 
		my HP Chromebook 11 G6 EE (snappy alan) laptop is burning up my lap at a very sad 76°C, 
		with only Discord, Firefox, and SSH open, and I'm literally using a 6W dual core Celeron N3350, 
		so it shouldn't even have enough power to get this hot anyways! 
		Please note I've gotten way higher before, (like 97°C). <br>

		Sure this is just a shitty Netbook, but what about the "good" laptops from an overhyped 
		brand? Surely a US$2,000 laptop if you get a good config shouldn't thermal throttle, right? 
		(They totally did not cheap out on fans for no reason, right?) <br><br>

		And to throw shots at Chromebooks too, 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjLkF232rTw">YouTube: Is The Samsung Chromebook Pro Overheating? - Chrome Unboxed</a> 
		is a good video that shows a random Samsung model reaching very sad temperatures during basic use 
		of the device. <br><br> 

		Although completely unrelated, 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ7rANqMWDg">YouTube: North Carolina student's Chromebook catches fire during Zoom class</a>, 
		and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWJTnNxdtXE">YouTube: Laptop overheats, starts smoking in North Carolina classroom</a> 
		are kinda silly videos showing older HP Chromebooks catching fire but this was battery related, not 
		the fact they are passively cooled.</p>
